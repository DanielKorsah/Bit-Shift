# Bit-Shift

Inspired by the 2020 Global Game Jam theme.

The game has 3 layers. 
- An input layer of 8 bits which can be flipped by the player.
- A Convolutional layer filled with logic gates which change...
- An output layer which displays 8 bits which are dependent on the previous 2 layers.

The goal is to match the output layer with a predefined imutable "target" byte of 8 bits, by flipping the appropriate input bits.
